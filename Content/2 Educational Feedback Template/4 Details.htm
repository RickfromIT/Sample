        <h2>4 Details</h2>
        <p>This is where you present the details about the property you visited.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Insert an image in the place holder on the right hand side of the slide</li>
            <li>On the left hand side you will see a number of questions, try to answer as many of these you can.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>You will see that there are four slides like this for each property each one contains different questions. Delete any questions that are not relevant to the property, for example the questions about the game drives if the property is in the middle of a town.</p>
        <p>Please try to fill in as much of the information requested as you can. All of the questions were added by Tour consultants, so this information is important to someone.</p>
