        <h2>Animations</h2>
        <p>There are some animations pre built into the template. You can make alterations to these to make your presentation more personal.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: square;">
            <li>Firstly select the text or text box you would like to animate</li>
            <li>Click on the animation tab in the ribbon</li>
            <li>Click on the add animation button</li>
            <li>Select one of the options</li>
            <li>You can also edit some of the settings for the animation by opening the animation pane and clicking on the drop down arrow next to the animation you are editing. For example you might want to change the speed or timings</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="Hint">When adding animations remember to ensure that these add to or emphasise the message you are trying to convey. Some times less is after all.</p>
