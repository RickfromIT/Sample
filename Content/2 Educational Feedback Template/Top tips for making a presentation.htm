        <ol>
            <li><b class="yellow_bold">Be Entertaining</b> - Speeches should be entertaining as well as informative. Put some emotion into your presentation and may be put in a joke or funny story.</li>
            <li><b class="yellow_bold">Slow down</b> - you might feel nervous and speak quickly, consciously take a breath and speak slowly, pause from time to time to let people take in what you are saying.</li>
            <li><b class="yellow_bold">Eye contact</b> - Making eye contact with all the people in the room will help the audience feel you are speaking to them.</li>
            <li><b class="yellow_bold">Don't read</b> - people often try to read from the PowerPoint slides to the audience, try to avoid this. Practice your presentation a couple of times before hand, and where needed use small cue cards.</li>
            <li><b class="yellow_bold">Don't plan your gestures</b> - the gestures you make when presenting need to be spontaneous and match the rest of your body language. Planed gestures look false and reduces the audience faith in you.</li>
            <li><b class="yellow_bold">That's a good question</b> - when you are asked a question you can start by saying things like "I am glad you asked" or "that's a good question". This gives you a few moments to order your response in your head.</li>
            <li><b class="yellow_bold">Keep it short</b> - Humans have a short attention span, especially when sitting listening for long periods of time. The audience will have the greatest concentration at the beginning and when you say something like "in conclusion". Keep your facts short, and make sure you are keeping it to the point.</li>
            <li><b class="yellow_bold">15 Word Summary</b> - can you summarize your point in 15 words? If not try to rewrite it so your message is clear.</li>
            <li><b class="yellow_bold">Project your voice</b> - it is important for the person at the back of the room to be able to hear you. It doesn’t mean you have to yell, but remember not to mumble.</li>
            <li><b class="yellow_bold">Have fun</b> - remember to have fun with your presentation. If you are passionate about what you are presenting then people will be passionate about hearing from you. </li>
        </ol>
